# StansGrocery
Stan's Grocery Search Program
***
## Program Function
* Stan's Grocery Store wants to implement a search app
* Write a program that will input items from the disk file
* The program should load the item data into an array that will be accessed as: 
  * `Food$(item, location, description)`
* Allow Stan's customers to enter the name of an item they want to locate by either:
  * typing the item’s name in a text box
  * selecting the item from a combo-box
  * selecting the item from a listbox
* The app will then search the array `Food$` for the desired item
* If found display the item's name, location, and description properly formatted in a Label control
* If the item is not found, inform the customer.
* When zzz is typed in the search text box the program stops.

The output should resemble the following:

Store the data file on the same disk and in the same folder as the program.
